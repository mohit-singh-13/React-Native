# React Native Demos 📱

Welcome to my **React Native** learning repository! This repo is a collection of small demo apps and projects I've built while learning React Native. Each folder contains a self-contained project, focusing on different concepts such as navigation, state management, API integration, Native Features and more.

## 🚀 Why this Repository?

I'm using this repository to:

- Practice new concepts
- Experiment with core APIs
- Explore popular libraries
- Build muscle memory through small apps
- Track my progress over time

## 🧠 What You'll Find

Each subdirectory inside this repo represents a separate demo or mini project. These cover:

- 📱 Basic UI layouts
- 🧭 Navigation (React Navigation)
- ⚙️ State Management (Hooks, Context API, Redux)
- 🌐 API Calls (using Axios or Fetch)
- 🔁 Forms and Validation
- 🎨 Styling with StyleSheet and custom themes
- 🧩 Native features like camera, storage, etc.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```bash
React-Native/

├── #3-meals-app/
├── #4-expense-tracker/
├── #5-authN-authZ/
├── #6-image-location-picker/
└── #7-notifications/
```

Each folder typically contains:

- `App.js` – Entry point of the app
- `README.md` – (Optional) Project-specific details
- `assets/` – Images and static files
- `components/`, `screens/`, etc. – As needed
