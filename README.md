# React Native Demos í³±

Welcome to my **React Native** learning repository! This repo is a collection of small demo apps and projects I've built while learning React Native. Each folder contains a self-contained project, focusing on different concepts such as navigation, state management, API integration, Native Features and more.

## íº€ Why this Repository?

I'm using this repository to:

- Practice new concepts
- Experiment with core APIs
- Explore popular libraries
- Build muscle memory through small apps
- Track my progress over time

## í·  What You'll Find

Each subdirectory inside this repo represents a separate demo or mini project. These cover:

- í³± Basic UI layouts
- í·­ Navigation (React Navigation)
- âš™ï¸ State Management (Hooks, Context API, Redux)
- í¼ API Calls (using Axios or Fetch)
- í´ Forms and Validation
- í¾¨ Styling with StyleSheet and custom themes
- í·© Native features like camera, storage, etc.

## í·‚ï¸ Folder Structure

```bash
React-Native/
â”œâ”€â”€ #1-goals-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ #2-guess-game/
â”œâ”€â”€ #3-meals-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ #4-expense-tracker/
â”œâ”€â”€ #5-authN-authZ/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each folder typically contains:

- `App.js` â€“ Entry point of the app
- `README.md` â€“ (Optional) Project-specific details
- `assets/` â€“ Images and static files
- `components/`, `screens/`, etc. â€“ As needed
